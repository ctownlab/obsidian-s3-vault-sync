Since man is made in God's image yet is corrupted, Christ came to renew his image. [1]

Christ is necessary for this because man is made in His image. Man couldn't renew themselves because they are "in the image" rather than the image itself. Nor could angels because they are not in the image at all. [1]

This is like when a portrait is ruined, if the person in the portrait is there it can be repainted on the same canvas. [1]
## Insights
* This makes me think of a master copy of a painting. Usually you will look for the  shapes, lines, etc. that the painting is made from. If you are painting directly you are forced to think about what shapes capture a person's essence best.
## Further Study
1. By what method does Christ renew the image? Is it through teaching, The Church, the Eucharist, all of the above?
