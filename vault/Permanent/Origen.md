An early Christian writer from before the First Council of Nicea. Some are sympathetic to him, but he was officially declared a heretic at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553. His most problematic teaching was universalism, i.e., that all creation would be saved in the end including demons and Satan. [1]

Other heretical teachings were that the Son and Holy Spirit were created beings, the pre-existence of the soul before incarnation, and merit from previous lives. Studied under Ammonius Saccus, who was one of the fathers of neo-platonism. Also under Clement of Alexandria. He was heavily influenced by Platonism and Gnosticism. [1]
