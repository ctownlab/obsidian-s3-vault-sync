Ancient Philosophers saw God is seen as impersonal. They use the term "unmoved mover". Here the term "mover" means something closer to "inspire" as the idea is that we want to be like it. Heavenly bodies are considered closest because they only move in circles, which is considered close to perfection. This God is bodiless and does not interact with it's creation.
