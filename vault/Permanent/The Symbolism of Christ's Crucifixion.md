When Christ died on the cross with his hands stretched out, this has to do with him bringing all people to himself. With one hand he brings the jews and the other hand the gentiles making the two groups one. He destroys the wall of hostility. [1]

Ephesians 2.2 describes the devil as the ruler of the kingdom of the air. Christ purifies the air through his death, which occurs in the air on the cross. [1]

2. What exactly is meant by "the ruler of the kingdom of the air". The interpretation by St. Athenasius of Christ dying in the air is quite literal.
