* Fleeting notes which are quick reminders of information. They need to be quickly converted into permanent notes or else the information will likely be lost forever.
* Literature notes should be extremely short.
* Permanent notes are not for collecting, but for developing ideas and discussions. They should generate questions and it's good for them to grapple with contradictory ideas. There should be one idea per note and they should be written in complete sentences. They are best if they contribute to the current discussion. 
* Project notes are only relevant for a specific project you're working on.
