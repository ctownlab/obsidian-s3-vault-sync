The notes interact with one another unlike in traditional note taking where everything is separated by categories. In this way they build up to a critical mass of ideas. 

Elaborating on ideas creates more anchors, which the slip box encourages. Elaboration is the process of connecting information to other information in a meaningful way.

This forms a feedback loop, which is a crucial tool in improving. We are confronted with ideas that don't correlate with each other and are forced to reconcile them.

This also helps with memory.
