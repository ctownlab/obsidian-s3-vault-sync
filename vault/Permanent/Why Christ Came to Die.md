God came to die so that death would become incorruptible due to Christ's perfection as the Word. [1]

This is comparable to when a great king comes to take residence in a city. No enemies will descend upon the city when it's under the king's protection. [1]

Christ's death fulfills a paradox. The death of all man is completed and the power of death is destroyed because of the death of Christ as the incorruptible Word. [1]
