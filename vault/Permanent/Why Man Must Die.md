Evil is the same as non-being and good the same as being. When Adam and Eve transgressed God's commandment in the Garden of Eden they had done evil therefore becoming corrupted with evil. This meant that they would have to return to non-being. [1]

## Insights
* This sounds less like God granting them **death** as a mercy but rather a consequence of their actions. Here it seems that God did not intervene. 

## Further Study
* How do the the ideas of "God granting death" and "a consequence of their actions" reconcile?
